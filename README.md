# Network Adjacency Matrix Generator

A Python tool for generating and combining adjacency matrices from trade network data.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or above installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy openpyxl

Usage
Important: Execution Order
First, run Adjacency-matrix.py to generate individual adjacency matrices from raw data.

Then, run Combined-matrix.py to combine all individual matrices into one.

Step-by-Step Guide
Prepare your data:  Ensure your raw data Excel file (e.g., 2010colzamat.xlsx) is in the project folder. It must contain three columns: Source, Target, and Weight.



Example data is available in the Example data folder. Please use it in the same environment.


Generate Individual Matrices:

bash
python Adjacency-matrix.py
This will read the raw data and create individual matrix files (e.g., matrix\\\_2010\\\_colza.xlsx).

Combine Matrices:

bash
python Combined-matrix.py
This will combine all matrix\\\_2010\\\_\\\*.xlsx files into a final combined\\\_matrix\\\_2010.xlsx.

File Description
Adjacency-matrix.py: Reads raw trade data and generates adjacency matrices.

Combined-matrix.py: Combines multiple adjacency matrices into a single file.

2010colzamat.xlsx: Example input file containing raw trade relationships.

matrix\\\_2010\\\_\\\*.xlsx: Individual adjacency matrices generated by matx.py.

combined\\\_matrix\\\_2010.xlsx: Final combined matrix (output).

Input Data Format
Your input Excel file should have the following columns:

Source: The origin country/region.

Target: The destination country/region.

Weight: The volume or strength of the trade relationship.

Note
This tool was developed for analyzing global oilseed trade networks and can be adapted for other trade relationship studies.
